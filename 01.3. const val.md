Kotlin for C# developers
# Variables
## const val
Equivalent to `const` in C#
* Must be initialised where it's declared
* Must be initialised with a compile-time constant value, whereas `val` is initialised at runtime
* Named in `SCREAMING_CASE` (like Java constants)

```c#
const int port = 80;
readonly string schema = "https";
readonly string host;  // Class field

// Later, in the constructor
host = "portswigger.net";
host = "portswigger.com";  // ERROR: can only assign once
```

```kotlin
const val PORT = 80   // As above, type can be inferred
val schema = "https"
val host: String   // Can be a class field or local (or even global)

// Later
host = "portswigger.net"
host = "portswigger.com"  // ERROR: can only assign once
```
