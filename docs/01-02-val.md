## 1.2. val
Values declared with `val` **cannot** be reassigned.

A `val` can be declared anywhere in Kotlin so there's no direct equivalent in C#. Nearest equivalents are:
* `readonly` fields
* `init` properties in C# 9.0

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
val firstName: String = "Bobby"
val lastName = "McBobface"   // Type can be inferred
lastName = "Smith"  // ERROR! Cannot reassign
```

A `val` can be declared and initialised separately (a bit like a `readonly` in C#), but then the type can't be inferred.

```kotlin
val firstName: String

// Later
firstName = "Bobby"
```
