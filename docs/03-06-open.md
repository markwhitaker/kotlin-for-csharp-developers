# open
In **C#**:
* classes are open for inheritance unless marked `sealed`
* methods and properties are closed for inheritance unless marked `virtual` (or `abstract`)
* overridden members in a non-sealed class are implicitly open but can be closed with `sealed`

**C#**
```csharp
public class BaseClass // You CAN extend this
{
    public string Property1 => "You CANNOT override this";
    public virtual string Property2 => "You CAN override this";
    public virtual string Method() => "You CAN override this";
}

public class OpenClass : BaseClass // You CAN extend this
{
    public sealed override string Property2 => "You CANNOT override this";
    public override string Method() => "You CAN override this";
}

public sealed class ClosedClass : BaseClass // You CANNOT extend this
{
    public override string Property2 => "You CANNOT override this";
    public override string Method() => "You CANNOT override this";
}
```

In **Kotlin**:
* everything is implicitly `final` (sealed) unless marked `open` (or `abstract`)
* overridden members in an `open` class are implicitly open but can be closed with `final`

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
open class BaseClass { // You CAN extend this
    val property1 = "You CANNOT override this"
    open val property2 = "You CAN override this"
    open fun method() = "You CAN override this"
}

open class OpenClass : BaseClass() { // You CAN extend this
    final override val property2 = "You CANNOT override this"
    override fun method() = "You CAN override this"
}

class ClosedClass : BaseClass() { // You CANNOT extend this
    override val property2 = "You CANNOT override this"
    override fun method() = "You CANNOT override this"
}
```
