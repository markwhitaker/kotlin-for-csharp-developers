# open
In **C#**:
* classes are open for inheritance unless marked `sealed`
* methods and properties are closed for inheritance unless marked `virtual` (or `abstract`)
* overridden members in a non-sealed class are implicitly open but can be closed with `sealed`

**C#**
```csharp
public class BaseClass
{
    public string Property1 => "You CAN'T override this";
    public virtual string Property2 => "You CAN override this";

    public virtual void DoStuff() => Log("You CAN override this");
}

public class OpenClass : BaseClass
{
    public sealed override string Property2 => "You CAN'T override this";

    public override void DoStuff() => Log("You CAN override this");
}

public sealed class ClosedClass : BaseClass // You CAN'T extend this
{
    public override string Property2 => "You CAN'T override this";

    public override void DoStuff() => Log("You CAN'T override this");
}
```

In **Kotlin**:
* everything is implicitly `final` (sealed) unless marked `open` (or `abstract`)
* overridden members in an `open` class are implicitly open but can be closed with `final`

**Kotlin**
```kotlin
open class BaseClass {
    val property1 = "You CAN'T override this"
    open val property2 = "You CAN override this"

    open fun doStuff() = log("You CAN override this")
}

open class OpenClass : BaseClass() {
    final override val property2 = "You CAN'T override this"

    override fun doStuff() = log("You CAN override this")
}

class ClosedClass : BaseClass() { // You CAN'T extend this
    override val property2 = "You CAN'T override this"

    override fun doStuff() = log("You CAN'T override this")
}
```
