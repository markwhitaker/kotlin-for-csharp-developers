Kotlin for C# developers
# Variables
## var
Values declared with `var` are a lot like C# variables and can be re-assigned

#### C#
```
string firstName = "Bobby";
var lastName = "McBobface";  // Type can be inferred
lastName = "Smith";
```

#### Kotlin
```
var firstName: String = "Bobby"
var lastName = "McBobface"   // Type can be inferred
lastName = "Smith"
```

**Note**: the type comes after the variable name
**Note**: no line-end semicolons (semicolons are very rare in Kotlin - we'll see one later...)
